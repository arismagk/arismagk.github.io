About Me
======

Greetings! I'm thrilled to welcome you to my personal website. I wear multiple hats, serving as a passionate SW Lead Engineer and sub-function Architect at ASML, based in the Netherlands. Additionally, I am actively pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Combinatorial Optimization and Optimal Experimental Design within the esteemed ECE Department at the University of Patras, Greece.
